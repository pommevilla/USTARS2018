# USTARS 2018  

The PDF and supporting materials for the talk I gave at USTARS 2018 at Reed College, titled "An Algebraic Definition of the Bridge Number of a Knot," about the research I did at California State University, Long Beach, with Ryan Blair, Alexandra Kjuchukova, and Roman Velazquez.  That paper is available [here][wirtpaper].

## Outline 

* Basics of knot theory
* The Wirtinger number of a knot diagram
* The minimal Wirtinger number of a knot equals its bridge number
* [An implementation][calc-wirt]
* Results
* Future Work

## Resources

* The original paper, [*Wirtinger systems of generators of knot groups*][wirtpaper]
* A Python 3 script to calculate the Wirtinger number of a diagram is available [here][calc-wirt].
* Puttipong Pongtanapaisan proved that this result holds for virtual links.  His paper: [*Wirtinger Numbers for Virtual Links*][virtuallinks]
* [This paper][incompat] by Blair, Kjuchukova, and Makoto proves that not every reduced, minimal crossing diagram realizes the minimum Wirtinger number of a knot.
* We added the bridge numbers for the 12 crossings knots to the KnotInfo database maintained by Charles Livingston at Indiana University.  You can find it [here][knotinfo].
* The Wirtinger numbers for prime knots of 13 crossings and higher can be found on Alexandra Kjuchukova's website [here][13+wirts].
