# USTARS 2018  

The PDF and supporting materials for the talk I gave at USTARS 2018 at Reed College. 

The title of the talk was "An Algebraic Definition of Bridge Number" and is about the research I did at California State University, Long Beach, with Ryan Blair, Alexandra Kjuchukova, and Roman Velazquez.  That paper is available [here][wirtpaper].

## Outline 

* Basics of knot theory
* The Wirtinger number of a knot diagram
* The minimal Wirtinger number of a knot equals its bridge number
* [An implementation][calc-wirt]
* Results
* Future Work
